My presentation for ANC Journal Club covers the paper “Acquiring Diverse Skills using Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Mixture of Experts” by Celik et al. My views do not reflect those of the authors and I have no affiliation with the authors. This presentation is simply an attempt by me to learn the subject and represents my best understanding at the time.
